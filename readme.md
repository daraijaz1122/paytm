- paytm wallet is a paytm wallet like clone where users can singup and transfer money to other users. The most important part covered in this project is transactions in databases in my case its (mongodb);
- This is a MERN stack project (FE:React,tailwind & BE:Node,Express,Mongodb).
- The various parts covered in this project include:

1.  created api's using node,mongodb,express.
2.  implemented authentication , so that logged in users can see other registered users (jwt's).
3.  implemented transactions ( so that user's can send money to other users , provided them with some random money in account on signup).
4.  created frontend for login,signup, a dashboard where user can see other users and his/her own account balance.

- To setup this project locally on your system follow these below mentioned steps.

2. navigate to cd/paytm/backend and run command (npx nodemon index.js ) to run backend.
3. navigate to cd/paytm/frontend and run command ( npm run dev) to run frontend .
